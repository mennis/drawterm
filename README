DETAILS
-------
This port of drawterm focuses on adding Cocoa drawing support to the Mac OS X
version as found in gui-osx-cocoa.  Additional updates have been added to bring
drawterm in line with recent changes in the Plan 9 source, specifically:

- libc restructured and updated

- libdraw, libmemdraw, and libmemlayer sources in line with recent Plan 9

- modified kern files bringing in updates from recent Plan 9 releases

- devdraw now allows window resize


INSTALLATION
--------------
To build on Mac OS X 10.8, run make 'CONF=osx-cocoa'.

To build on Unix, run CONF=unix make.

To build on Solaris using Sun cc, run CONF=sun make.

To build on Windows, you need Mingw.  See http://www.mingw.org.
Edit Make.config to uncomment the Windows section
and comment out the rest.  Then run CONF=windows make.

(You can download nmake from 
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q132084
Rename it to make.exe and put it in your path somewhere.
)

I haven't tested the Windows build on Windows itself.
I cross-compile using mingw32 on Linux.
